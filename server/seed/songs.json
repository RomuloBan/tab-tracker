      "[Verse 1: Ed Droste]\nI made a mistake\nI should have never tried\nI took the cake\nFinished every slice\nI moved away\nStill playing off the fights\nFor every day\nI share our love delight\n\n[Verse 2: Ed Droste]\nI stare at the face\nLooking through my eyes\nI move at a pace\nThat I cannot survive\nI'm hauling away\nI do it all the time\nLet love age\nAnd watch it burn out and die\n\n[Chorus: Daniel Rossen]\nI woke to the sound of dogs\nTo the sound of distant shots and passing trucks\nWe woke with the mourning sound\nIt's the sound of distant shots and passing trucks\nWe woke with the mourning sound\nIt's the sound of distant shots and passing trucks\n \n\n[Verse 3: Ed Droste]\nI own the faith\nCould never have denied\nThis isn't a place\nWhere I can even try\nI'm hauling away\nI do it all the time\nLet love age\nAnd watch it burn out and die\n\n[Chorus: Daniel Rossen]\nWe woke with the mourning sound\nIt's the sound of distant shots and passing trucks\nWe woke with the mourning sound\nIt's the sound of distant shots and passing trucks\nWe woke with the mourning sound\nIt's the sound of distant shots and passing trucks",

I want it\n(Everything now!) I can't live without\n(Everything now!) I can't live without\n(Everything now!)\n(Everything now!)\nEverything now\nEvery ancient road's got a town\nDaddy, how come you're never around?\nI miss you, like everything now\nMama, leave the food on the stove\nLeave your car in tf the road\nThis happy family with everything now\nWe turn the speakers up till they break\n'Cause every time you smile it's a fake!\nStop pretending, you've got\nI need it\n(Everything now!) I want it\n(Everything now!) I can't live without\n(Everything now!) I can't live without\n(Everything now!)\n(Everything now!)\n'Til every room in my house is filled with shit I couldn't live without\nI need it\n(Everything now!) I can't live without\n(Everything now!)\n(Everything now!)\nEverything now\nLa La La La La La La\nLa La La La La La La\nStop pretending, you've got\nI need it\n(Everything now!) I want it\n(Everything now!) I can't live without\n(Everything now!) I can't live without\n(Everything now!) I can't live\n(Everything now!)\nAnd every room in my house is filled with shit I couldn't live without\n(Everything now!) I need it\n(Everything now!) I can't live without\n(Everything now!) I can't live\n(Everything now!)\nEvery inch of space in my heart is filled with something I'll never start\nThe ashes of everything now\nAnd then you're black again\nCan't make it back again\nFrom everything now",
